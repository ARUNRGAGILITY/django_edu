[question1]
question1=What is the result of slicing a list in Python, and how does it differ from copying the entire list?
options1=Slicing creates a new list, copying references the same list; Slicing and copying both create shallow copies; Slicing creates a shallow copy, copying creates a deep copy; Slicing creates a deep copy, copying creates a shallow copy
correctAnswer1=2

[question2]
question2=In Python, how does a bytearray differ from a bytes object?
options2=bytearray is mutable, bytes is immutable; bytes is mutable, bytearray is immutable; There is no difference; bytearray is used for text data, bytes for binary data
correctAnswer2=1

[question3]
question3=What is the primary use of a 'Counter' object in the 'collections' module?
options3=To count the occurrence of each element in an iterable; To ensure thread-safe operations on data; To implement a timer; To count the number of iterations in a loop
correctAnswer3=1

[question4]
question4=When would you use a 'defaultdict' instead of a regular dictionary in Python?
options4=When you need to store items in order; When keys being searched might not exist; When you need to perform complex calculations on keys; When the dictionary needs to be immutable
correctAnswer4=2

[question5]
question5=What is the difference between 'append()' and 'extend()' methods in Python lists?
options5='append()' adds a single element, 'extend()' adds multiple elements; 'extend()' adds a single element, 'append()' adds multiple elements; There is no difference; 'append()' is faster than 'extend()'
correctAnswer5=1

[question6]
question6=In Python, what is 'dictionary comprehension'?
options6=A method to iterate over dictionaries; A syntax to create dictionaries from iterables; A built-in function for sorting dictionaries; A module for handling complex dictionary operations
correctAnswer6=2

[question7]
question7=What is the purpose of the 'chain' function in the itertools module?
options7=To link multiple iterators together; To create combinations of elements; To repeat an iterator a specified number of times; To filter elements from an iterator
correctAnswer7=1

[question8]
question8=How is 'OrderedDict' different from a regular dictionary in Python?
options8=OrderedDict maintains the order of insertion; OrderedDict is faster; There is no difference as of Python 3.7; OrderedDict allows duplicate keys
correctAnswer8=1

[question9]
question9=What is the function of the '__iter__' method in Python?
options9=To initialize an object; To return an iterator from an object; To perform iteration in a for loop; To modify the behavior of an iterator
correctAnswer9=2

[question10]
question10=In Python, how does 'enumerate' function enhance the functionality of a loop?
options10=By adding a counter to an iterable; By speeding up the loop; By reducing memory usage in the loop; By reversing the order of the loop
correctAnswer10=1
