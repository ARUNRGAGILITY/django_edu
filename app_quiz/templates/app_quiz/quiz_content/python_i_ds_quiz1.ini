options1=List and Tuple; List and List; Tuple and Dictionary; Dictionary and List
correctAnswer1=2

[question2]
question2=How does a 'set' differ from a 'list' in Python?
options2=A set is ordered, a list is not; A set cannot contain duplicate elements, a list can; A list is faster for iteration; A set can store complex data types, a list cannot
correctAnswer2=2

[question3]
question3=What is the time complexity of accessing an element in a Python list?
options3=O(1); O(n); O(log n); O(n^2)
correctAnswer3=1

[question4]
question4=In Python, what is a 'deque' and which module provides this data structure?
options4=It's a double-ended queue provided by the 'collections' module; It's a data type for decimal arithmetic provided by the 'decimal' module; A debugging tool provided by the 'pdb' module; A distributed task queue provided by the 'celery' module
correctAnswer4=1

[question5]
question5=What is the main characteristic that differentiates a 'frozenset' from a 'set' in Python?
options5=A frozenset is faster; A frozenset is ordered; A frozenset is immutable; A frozenset can store only numeric values
correctAnswer5=3

[question6]
question6=Which Python data structure is commonly used for implementing a graph?
options6=List; Set; Dictionary; Tuple
correctAnswer6=3

[question7]
question7=What is the main advantage of using a 'namedtuple' over a regular tuple in Python?
options7=It consumes less memory; It allows for faster access to its elements; Elements can be accessed by name as well as by index; It can store more data types
correctAnswer7=3

[question8]
question8=How is a 'heap' different from a regular binary tree in Python?
options8=A heap allows for faster search operations; A heap is always a complete binary tree, whereas a binary tree need not be; A heap does not allow duplicate values, but a binary tree does; A heap is implemented using arrays, while a binary tree uses linked nodes
correctAnswer8=2

[question9]
question9=In Python, what does the 'zip' function return when applied to two lists of unequal length?
options9=A list of tuples with length equal to the shorter list; A list of tuples with length equal to the longer list; An error; A list of tuples filled with None for missing elements
correctAnswer9=1

[question10]
question10=When would you use a 'bisect' module in Python?
options10=For binary tree operations; For binary search in a sorted list; For binary encoding and decoding; For bitwise operations on data
correctAnswer10=2
